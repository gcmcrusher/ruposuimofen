## Sub
The sub-base layer is often the main load-bearing layer of a pavement. It is designed to evenly spread the load of the paving, and any traffic thereon, to the sub-grade below. A well-constructed sub-base will aid drainage and prevent settlement and channelisation - the phenomenon common on cheap installations of block paving, where two 'ruts' develop in the paving.
